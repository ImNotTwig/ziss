* Things to do:
** TODO Implement a plugin system for the repl so that you can insert custom commands at compile time
maybe also do this for normal commands idk
** TODO Refactor the age command interface in the case when someone has an age key protected additionally with a passphrase
** TODO Write the arg parsing library and integrate both the repl and normal cli with it
** TODO Fix the way i parse the account file format, eg: it probably breaks if theres multiple = in the same line
also maybe i should tokenize it?
